        <h1>Oops I did it again</h1>
        <h2>Song by Britney Spears</h2>
        <p>Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
            Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah</p>
        <p>I think I did it again
            I made you believe we're more than just friends
            Oh baby
            It might seem like a crush
            But it doesn't mean that I'm serious
            'Cause to lose all my senses
            That is just so typically me
            Oh baby, baby</p>
        <p>Oops, I did it again
            I played with your heart, got lost in the game
            Oh baby, baby
            Oops, you think I'm in love
            That I'm sent from above
            I'm not that innocent</p>
        <p>You see my problem is this
            I'm dreaming away
            Wishing that heroes, they truly exist
            I cry, watching the days
            Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways
            But to lose all my senses
            That is just so typically me
            Oh baby, oh</p>
        <p>Oops, I did it again
            I played with your heart, got lost in the game
            Oh baby, baby
            Oops, you think I'm in love
            That I'm sent from above
            I'm not that innocent</p>
        <p>Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
            Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah</p>
        <p>Oops, I did it again to your heart
            Got lost in this game, oh baby
            Oops, you think that I'm sent from above
            I'm not that innocent
            Oops, I did it again
            I played with your heart, got lost in the game
            Oh baby, baby</p>
        <p>Oops, you think I'm in love
            That I'm sent from above
            I'm not that innocent
            Oops, I did it again
            I played with your heart, got lost in the game
            Oh baby, baby
            Oops, you think I'm in love
            That I'm sent from above
            I'm not that innocent</p>
